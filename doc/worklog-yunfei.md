算法采用Bilge和Ulusoy等人设计的40个算例进行验证。
对此类问题做如下假设：

（1）机器旁出入缓冲区容量无限大；

（2）所有工件和AGV起始位置和加工完成回到的位置都在L/U站；

（3）不考虑AGV运输过程中的碰撞和故障；

## cepdnaclk/e16-3yp-smart-pharmaceutical-warehousing: In this project, we are trying to address this issue by developing a fully automated warehouse management that will minimize the drawbacks while improving efficiency and profitability. We are implementing a warehouse management system which consists two types of robots; robots arms to handle loading/unloading of goods, automated guided vehicles to transport goods inside the warehouse. Also, an online shopping portal to make the purchases from the warehouse. { 
https://github.com/cepdnaclk/e16-3yp-smart-pharmaceutical-warehousing
The warehouse has two base stations, the delivery post and receiving post, to deliver goods to the customers and receive any stocks to the warehouse respectively.

~ unity !!!! amazing todo-shiyue
mostly same as my thought
    In addition, they also stop giving priority to the robots that they detect on their right.
    For example, the robotic arm is locked in all states except in the PickingUp state. The robot can only receive new tasks in the Available state. Also, in the PickingUp, RampGoingDown, Unloading, and RampGoingUp states, the rotation of the robot and wheels is automatically locked. 
Coppelia: https://github.com/abel-gr/warehouse-robot/wiki#realistic-simulation
                /CoppeliaSim /
We also have designed a website where the warehouse orders are stored, and a human worker can add manually and with his/her own voice orders to be processed by the robot swarm.
minimize the total time of the collection of boxes from the warehouse 
When the training mode is enabled after a certain number of orders are processed by the robots, `the weights of the formula used to determine which robot is the most suitable for picking an order are modified in each iteration.`
what is node? 2 folds meaning.
Head-on collisions cannot occur because all nodes have a single direction of driving. // node == robot

warhouse_node.cs // node is the every shelf
It begins to go towards him and once he arrives he changes his status to Available because now the robot is located in one of the nodes of the warehouse.
Warehouse_orders.cs
The calculation of the formula includes values such as the distance to the order, the number of orders processed and the capacity of each robot, and all the values have certain weights that are calculated in the Warehouse_training.cs script.
Warehouse_shelf.cs
Each shelf script has two Warehouse_node.cs scripts associated to it, of the nodes that are at the left and the right of that shelf, allowing the robots to know the node coordinates of the shelf where is the box that must be picked up.
it will be able to move towards a value of X (or Z depending on the variable) that is greater than the one it is, that is, in a positive direction. If it is false, it can only move in the negative direction. In this way, lane generation is also automated and works perfectly.

algo:
    OptimalRoute.cs
        It has a recursive backtracking algorithm to calculate the optimal path between two warehouse nodes. It has various conditions to prune branches so it runs fast.
    warehouse_training.cs
        In case that the container is full, the robot itself will set the OnWayToDrop status and go to the box unloading area. Otherwise, it will remain in Available until the Warehouse_orders.cs script assigns it another box to collect, and the process will start again. //
        In each iteration, the weights are modified with the inverse of the time it took for all the robots to process a certain number of orders specified in the ordersPerIteration variable.
